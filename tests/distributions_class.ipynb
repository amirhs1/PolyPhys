    "        1. Finding the bins (more precisely, the edges) by which the boundary \\\n",
    "        (or volume) of a particle intersects. In practice, the lower and \\\n",
    "        upper limits of these edges are found.\n",
    "        2. Calculating the share of each bin from the volume of a bead.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    To find the upper and lower bounds on edges, the center of a bead with \\\n",

    "    above assumption, for a given `self.r_bead`, a pair of lower and upper \\\n",
    "    bounds (`self.bounds`) can be found for each center. It is assumed \\\n",

    "    Distributions computes the local number density of any type of particle and the local volume fraction of bead (spheres) in 1D (cylinder with the eperiodic boundary condition (PBC) along the longitudinal axis (z axis)), 2D (slit with the PBC along the x and y axes (radial direction)), and 3D (cube with the PBC along x, y, and z axes (spheric)).\n",
    "        Here it is assumed that particles are hard so their volume of intersections with bins are numerically calculated in full details. However, particles can also be soft, so their volume can follw a particle distribution such as the normal distribution. Indeed, the soft particle approcimation is a more reasonbale choice for Lennard-Jones particles. If the sof particle distribution is desirable, this class should be extended to have a functionality to take an arbitrary function as the volume distribution function for particles. The soft-particle approximation is indeed similar to methods in other branches of STEM to smooth a histogram.\n",
    "    There are three types of bins: concenteric bins (and thus concentric edges) along the radial direction, consecutive bins along the longitudinal direction, and cyclic consecutive bins along the polar and azimuthal directions. This method correctly finds the bounds in the first two cases.\n",
    "    The histogram (frequecny of occurance) and number denisty are functions of one bin/bin center/a pair of consecutive edges:\n",
    "    If H_i the freiqency of particle in in bin or at bin center i, then rho_i=H_i/V_i is the number density and V_i is the volume of the bin i. \n",
    "    However, the volume fraction is a function of several bins. More precisely, the number of bins is set by the ratio of the bead size (diameter) R divided by the bin size h: M_j<=R/h is the number of bins with which the bead intersect/overlaps where j is the index of a bin or bin center. the smaller relation (<) holds when the bead which is close to the boundaries (the left and right boundary along longitudinal direction or the outermost boundary along the radial direction). In other cases, the equality (=) holds. In other words, the volume of a bead is shared amoing M_j bins, so it is need to find the volume of intersection of the bead and a bin. For the sake of similipcity, it is assumed all the particles that are in bin i with frequency H_i are located at the bin center, so we have a bin/test bead that is located at the center of bin. There are N bins or bin centers, test or bin bead, frequnecies H_i,  number densities rho, and volume fraction phi while there is  N+1 bin edges.\n",
    "    The volume fraction phi_i of bin i is the sum over all the shares that bin i have from the volumes of N bin/test beads; in other words, phi_i=The sum over rho_j*v_j where P_i is the number of shares (the number of terms in the sum) that bin i have from the volumes of N bin/test beas, v_j is the volume share of the bin_i from bin/test bead j and rho_j is the number density of the bin j in which the bin/test bead j resides.\n",
    "    Due to the above-described assumption and the one-dimensional nature of the problem (frequencies, densities, and volume fractions are measured along one direction), it is needed to find the volume share v_j once for each bin/test bead.\n",
    "    The distribution functions (histogras, number densities, and volume fractions) are averaged twice: First, over all the measurements in one simulation (time-averaging), this steps result in the distributions of an individual simulation. Then, the time averages distribution of interest is avaraged over all the thermoynamiclly-equivalent simulation in an ensemble and an ensemble-averaged distribution is generated.\n",
