For each particle species, we calculate the normalized local volume fraction (number density) by dividing its ensemble-averaged local volume fraction by its diameter. This normalized distribution is called the "normalized local volume fraction" (number density).

At a fixed pair of the large monomer diameter and bulk crowder volume fraction, we construct the sum rule by adding the normalized local volume fractions (number densities) together. In the same conditions, we also determine the maximum of the normalized crowder local volume fraction (number density), which is typically located within the crowder-only region. To enhance visual clarity, we rescale the sum rule with this maximum value for each fixed pair of the large monomer diameter and bulk crowder volume fraction. Any deviation from unity after this rescaling indicates a breakdown of the sum rule.

For both small and large monomers, we rescale the local volume fraction (number density) using its value at r=0 (the smallest bin) for the same fixed pair of the large monomer diameter and bulk crowder volume fraction. Additionally, we rescale the crowder local volume fraction (number density) using the maximum value found in the crowder-only region, again for the same fixed conditions.
