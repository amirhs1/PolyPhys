# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it **privately**. **Do not file a public issue.** This allows time to investigate and fix the problem before the details are exposed publicly, reducing the risk of malicious exploitation.

To report a vulnerability, please use [this form](https://github.com/amirhs1/PolyPhys/security/advisories/new). In your report, include the following:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue, including code snippets or test cases if applicable

This project is maintained by a single developer on a reasonable-effort basis. I kindly ask that you allow up to **90 days** to address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
