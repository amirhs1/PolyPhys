    "Due to the finite time of a molecular dynamics, there is always some degree of correlation within a set of computational measurement. To esimate this correlation and incorporate it in the error analysis, *statistical inefficiency (SI)* is defined based on the relation between the variance of the mean and the autocorrelation function of the quantity of interest, and then, it is measured using different computational techniques ([Tildesley](https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198803195.001.0001), [Rapaport](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511816581))\n",

In this method, the original data set is sequentially chunked in $N_{block}=\\{1,2,4,8, 2^{M}\\dots <N\\}$ blocks. The data in each set of new blocks are the mean of $N_{block}$ data in the original data set. In each blocking tranform, the SE $s$ is measured in the following way\n",
