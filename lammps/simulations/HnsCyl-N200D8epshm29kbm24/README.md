# HnsCub Simulation Project

## Overview

This repository contains the input files, scripts, and data for a series of molecular dynamics simulations conducted using LAMMPS. The project is referred to as **HnsCub** and aims to explore the behaviors and properties of specific molecular systems as detailed in the associated research paper.

## Project Details

- **Project Short Name:** HnsCyl-N200D8epshm29kbm24
- **Paper Link:** --
- **Start Date of Project:** 2023-04-06

## Note

- Bad experiment design; the system was saturated (High H-NS binding)
  even at both small values of H-NS dimers and crowders.
- *epshc* is 1.
